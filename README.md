Data for sale
=====
I'm Shawn Buckles and I wil sell my data to the highest bidder.

Everyday, I collect a vast amount of personal data. The computers I’m surrounded with have memory: they monitor my every move. While current legislation is lagging, organizations trade my privacy massively.

I agree to all of this by using services as Google, Facebook and Apple. They specialize in collecting data on (consumer)behavior, location and interests -and use my (online) conversations and agenda to map out my networks.

Though the real problem lies with governments misusing this big data.

Facebook isn’t free.

You pay with your identity.
